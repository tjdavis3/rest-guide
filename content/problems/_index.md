A list of problem types is standardized in this guide for reuse across all REST APIs.
They are defined as URNs of format `urn:problem-type:<type>`.

<div class="warning">

`href` links to descriptions of standardized problem types will change in the future to recommended format containing full problem type identifier without HTML extension. Current URLs will redirect.
